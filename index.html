      The <span class="serif">City of New York</span> was introduced to
      professional football on the same day that the city was introduced to the
      <span class="fantasy">New York Giants</span>. It was a clear sunny
      <span class="mono">October afternoon in 1925</span>
      when the Giants took the field to play against the
      <span class="cursive">Frankford Yellow Jackets</span>.

      <span class="head">The Sneakers Game</span><br />
      In 1934 the
      <span class="giant">New York Giants</span> beat the
      <span class="bears">Chicago Bears</span>, by
      <span class="score">30-13</span>, in nine-degree temperatures [
      <span class="venue">at the Polo Grounds</span>
      ] in a game that has become famous as the “Sneakers Game.” With the
      <span class="giant">Giants</span> trailing
      <span class="score">10-3</span> at the half, head coach
      <span class="coach">Steve Owen</span> provided his squad with basketball
      shoes to increase traction on the icy turf. The team responded with four
      touchdowns in the second half to turn the game into a
      <span class="giant">Giants</span> rout.
